DINOSAUR 1:  
Name:		Triceratops
Description:
	 Bearing a large bony frill and three horns on the skull, and
	 its large four-legged body possessing similarities with the
	 modern rhinoceros, Triceratops is one of the most recognizable
	 of all dinosaurs and the best known ceratopsid. It was also
	 one of the largest, up to nine metres long and twelve tonnes
	 in weight. It shared the landscape with and was probably
	 preyed upon by Tyrannosaurus, though it is less certain that
	 the two did battle in the manner often depicted in museum
	 displays and popular images. The functions of the frills and
	 three distinctive facial horns on its head have long inspired
	 debate. Traditionally, these have been viewed as defensive
	 weapons against predators. More recent interpretations find
	 it probable that these features were primarily used in species
	 identification, courtship and dominance display, much like
	 the antlers and horns of modern species.
